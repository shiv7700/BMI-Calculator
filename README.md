# BMI

A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a tool used to assess an individual's body mass index. BMI is a measure of body fat based on a person's weight and height. It is commonly used as a simple and quick screening tool to categorize individuals into different weight status categories.

The formula for calculating BMI is:

```
const bmi = weight (kg) / height * height (cm) / 10000
â€‹

```

Once the BMI is calculated, it is usually categorized into different ranges to help assess an individual's weight status. The categories often include:

- Underweight: BMI less than 18.5
- Normal weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
- Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9
- Obesity: BMI of 30 or greater

It's important to note that BMI has limitations and does not directly measure body fat percentage or distribution. It is a general screening tool and may not be suitable for everyone, such as athletes with high muscle mass. For a more comprehensive assessment of health, it's recommended to consult with a healthcare professional who can consider other factors along with BMI.
